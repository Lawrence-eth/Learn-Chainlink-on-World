Performance optimization is also important. This includes structuring your JavaScript code for efficiency, minimizing unnecessary API calls, and formatting your return data to reduce on-chain gas costs. Small optimizations can lead to significant cost savings as your application scales.

Finally, consider implementing monitoring and alerting systems to quickly identify and respond to any issues with your functions. This proactive approach helps maintain the reliability of your application and ensures a smooth user experience even as external APIs and services evolve.`
